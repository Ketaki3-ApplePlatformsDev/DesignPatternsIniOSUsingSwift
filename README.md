# Design Patterns In iOS using Swift
I'll try to cover all Architectural, Creational, Structural and Behavioural Design patterns that can be implemented in iOS using Swift.

# What is a Design Pattern?: 
> A design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. 
> It's not a finished design but a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

# Uses of Design Patterns: 
> Design patterns provide general solutions, documented in a format that doesn't require specifics tied to a particular problem.
> They can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. 
> Their reuse helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems to the app. 
> They also improve code readability for coders and architects familiar with the patterns.
